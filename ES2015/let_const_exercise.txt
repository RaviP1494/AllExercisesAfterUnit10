Difference between var and let?

- var is pre-ES2015, has function scope as opposed to block scope, global var variables can be accessed on the DOM through the window object,
can be redeclared, and can be used in an earlier line than the declaration thanks to hoisting

Difference between var and const?

- var has function scope, const has block scope;
- var can be redeclared and redefined, const can only be declared and defined once;
- var variables can be accessed through window object on DOM, const can't

Difference between let and const?

- let can be redefined, const can only be assigned once(reference types like objects and arrays can be mutated, but not wholly redefined)

What's hoisting?

- The javascript language works by declaring all var variables in each block before moving on to the first line of code inside. This is called hoisting.
Because of this, var variables can be called before they are ever declared in the block.
